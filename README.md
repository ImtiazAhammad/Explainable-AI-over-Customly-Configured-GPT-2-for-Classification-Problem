# Explainable-AI-over-Customly-Configured-GPT-2-for-Classification-Problem


Welcome to the **Explainable AI over Customly Configured GPT-2 for Classification Problem** repository! This project focuses on using a customized version of GPT-2 to solve classification problems with a strong emphasis on explainability. By integrating explainable AI techniques, this repository provides insights into how the model makes decisions, making it easier to trust and understand its outputs.

### Introduction

This repository aims to leverage the capabilities of GPT-2, a state-of-the-art language model, for classification tasks. The custom configuration allows the model to be fine-tuned specifically for classification, while the explainability features help in understanding the rationale behind the model's predictions.

### Features

- **Custom GPT-2 Configuration**: Tailor GPT-2 for various classification problems, ensuring high performance and relevance.
- **Explainable AI**: Implement explainability techniques to provide insights into model decisions, enhancing transparency and trust.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Tools for evaluating model performance on different metrics, ensuring robustness and reliability.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Visual tools to explore and understand the modelâ€™s behavior and decision-making process.

### Dataset

The dataset should be prepared in a CSV format with the following columns:

- `text`: The input text for classification.
- `label`: The target label for classification.

Example:
```csv
text,label
"This is a positive review.",positive
"This is a negative review.",negative
```

### Model Training

To train the custom GPT-2 model, use the `train.py` script. Ensure your dataset is properly formatted and specify the required parameters for training. The training process includes:

1. Loading and preprocessing the data.
2. Configuring the GPT-2 model for classification.
3. Fine-tuning the model on the training data.
4. Saving the trained model for future use.

### Evaluation

Evaluate the model using the `evaluate.py` script. This script provides detailed performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Evaluation helps in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the model.

### Explainability

The key feature of this repository is the explainability of the GPT-2 model. Use the `explain.py` script to generate explanations for the model's predictions. This includes:

- Highlighting important words or phrases that influenced the decision.
- Providing visualizations that map out the decision-making process.
- Offering textual explanations that can be easily understood by non-experts.
